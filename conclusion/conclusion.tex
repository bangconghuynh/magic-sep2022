\begin{frame}{Conclusion and Outlook}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Completed:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Developed a \emphit{Magenta}{unitary}-symmetry-based framework to characterise the \emphit{Magenta}{spatial} properties of magnetically induced current densities
      \item Tested the framework on simple, high-symmetry systems
    \end{itemize}

    \item To do:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Relate the unitary symmetry of current densities to other magnetic properties calculated from them
      \item Extend the framework to \emphbf{DarkGreen}{corepresentations} to take into account \emphit{Magenta}{antiunitary} symmetry
      \item Consider also \emphbf{DarkGreen}{double-valued} representations and corepresentations to handle odd-electron systems correctly
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
